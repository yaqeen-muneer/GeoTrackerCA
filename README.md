## GeoTracker - Water Quality Regularity Information in CA USA 

## Project Overview
This Project Investigate Groundwater monitoring in California, USA

#### Introduction 
GeoTracker is a data management system developed by the California Water Boards, designed to monitor sites that affect water quality, especially groundwater. The system contains various records for sites requiring cleanup, such as leaking underground storage tanks, Department of Defense sites, as well as irrigated lands, oil and gas production facilities, and land disposal sites, with the goal of protecting and preserving the stateâ€™s water resources.

#### Problem Statement

Between 1966 and 2025, GeoTracker monitoring indicates that California's groundwater pollution risk has remained in the medium zone ( 40-80%), showing minimal progress despite decades of monitioring. Presistent contamination continues to affect local communities public health. 

#### Approches
1- Number of sites and their states between 1966-2025
2- Trends of Poluution Vulnerability over the years
3- Explore counties with the highest CalEnviroScreen 4.0 scores
4- Most common contaminants found in groundwater

## Dataset
Datasource: https://catalog.data.gov/organization/about/ca-gov

CSV File: geotracker.csv

Columns: 46, Rows: 75063

## Analysis


#### Findings
1- Oil & Gas Industry Dominates Cleanup Work

2- Pollution Vulnerability Remains Stable at The Middle Risk Zone

3- Regulatory Success in Closing Sittes on Simple Cases


#### Recommendations 
1- Enfoce Strict Industrial Regulations 

2- Proritize Complex Site Remediation Instead of Taking More

3- Target High-Risk Counties
