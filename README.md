## Groundwater - Water Quality Regularity Information in CA USA 

## Project Overview
This Project Investigate Groundwater monitoring in California, USA

### Introduction 


### Problem Statement: 

Between 1966 and 2025, GeoTracker monitoring indicates that California's groundwater pollution risk has remained in the medium zone ( 40-80%), showing minimal progress despite decades of monitioring. Presistent contamination continues to affect local communities public health.
