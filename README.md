This project investigate Groundwater monitoring in California, USA
Size = , Columns = 

### Introduction 
GeoTracker is California’s Water Boards system for tracking sites that affect water quality, especially groundwater. Data from 1966–2025 shows that groundwater pollution risk has stayed in the medium range (40–80%), with little progress despite decades of monitoring. Persistent contamination continues to threaten public health and the environment.

### Problem Statement: 

Between 1966 and 2025, GeoTracker monitoring indicates that California's groundwater pollution risk has remained in the medium zone ( 40-80%), showing minimal progress despite decades of monitioring. Presistent contamination continues to affect local communities public health.
